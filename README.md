# Spending Wisely

The Spending Wisely application allows a user to track their budget when they make withdrawals and deposits with or without a network so that it will keep an accurate balance. If internet connection is not available, the user can still input expenses or deposits. When either the deposits or expenses are inputed, the user will be notified. Once the internet connection reestablishes, the deposits or expenses that were inputed during offline will be added and the total will be updated. Give Spending Wisely a try so you can be more cautious about your spending.
